# Restaurant Recommender System

Welcome to our Module 3 Project! This app helps users find restaurants based on user preferences like food type and price. We use three different approaches: a simple ranking method, a machine learning model and a deep learning transformer model.

## Live App

The app is deployed and running on Render:  
**https://module3project.onrender.com**

## Data Pipeline

All data was sourced from the Yelp Open Dataset (https://business.yelp.com/data/resources/open-dataset/): real-world data from Yelp related to restaurant businesses. This data includes customer reviews, price range, photos, check-ins, hours of operation, parking availability, and ambiance. We downloaded the JSON provided on this website, and we scraped a subset of that data as a separate JSON to train our models. Then, the data was cleaned optimally and individually for each of our three approaches. Due to the highly detailed nature of the dataset, we chose to focus on features that would be helpful in rudimentary recommendation systems.

## Models Included

### 1. Naive Recommender
- Ranks restaurants by Yelp star ratings and review counts
- Simple and fast with no training needed
- Works well for users who just want top-rated places quickly

### 2. Classical Machine Learning Model (Denoising Autoencoder)
- Built using a denoising autoencoder in PyTorch
- Trained on a subset of Yelp data
- Recommends similar restaurants using learned embeddings and cosine similarity

### 3. Deep Learning Recommender (Transformers4Rec)
- Uses a Sentence Transformer to embed restaurant categories
- Accepts a user query and returns relevant results based on cosine similarity
- Strong performance in understanding food type preferences

## Evaluation
We evaluated the three different recommendation approaches: Naive, Classical Machine Learning (Denoising Autoencoder) and Deep Learning (Transformer-based embeddings). Each model was tested against real user queries in the deployed web application. Below is a summary of the observed performance for each method.

### Naive Model
- Approach: This model filters restaurants by food category like “Sushi” or “Tacos” and matches them to the user’s selected price level. Then, it sorts the results by Yelp star rating and number of reviews
  
- Performance: It’s quick and almost always returns highly-rated restaurants. It’s great when you are just looking for the most popular or best reviewed places within a certain type of food and budget
  
- Observation: Even though the filtering is pretty simple, it still performs well for most queries. The downside is that it does not do much beyond matching exact keywords, so it might miss places that are a good fit but don’t use the exact same wording in their categories
  
- Best Use Case: Fast, reliable results when you want top rated spots for a specific food type and price range

### Classical Machine Learning Model (Denoising Autoencoder)
- Approach: This model uses a denoising autoencoder to learn compressed representations of restaurant metadata. It identifies recommendations by comparing the similarity of embeddings
  
- Performance: The model captures more nuance than the naive approach. It provides a wider variety of recommendations, especially when the query is broad or lacks detail
  
- Observation: It balances category relevance and diversity well. Some results may not have the highest ratings, but they align more closely with the intent behind the user’s input. It is especially effective when users are unsure of exactly what they want
  
- Best Use Case: When a user wants personalized results that consider both content similarity and variety

### Deep Learning Model (Transformer-Based Embeddings)
- Approach: This model uses SentenceTransformer to semantically encode both restaurant descriptions and user queries. Recommendations are generated by comparing embedding vectors using cosine similarity

- Performance: 

- Observation:

- Best Use Case:
  
## Ethics Statement
While using real Yelp data, we ensured that no personal information was exposed and we avoided misrepresenting any individuals or businesses.

We do not store or collect any user interaction data. This system is intended to provide general restaurant recommendations and should not be used as the sole decision-making tool, especially for dietary restrictions, allergies or other sensitive considerations.
